Two people. No common language. A live translated call with a mediator that refuses
to record an agreement that isn't one.

**Declared Sarvam parameter: VOICE EXPERIENCE.** One parameter. Extra APIs score zero.

## The thesis

Vatsa says maintenance is *alag* — separate, meaning actual repair costs. Sreedev
agrees, meaning a fixed ₹500/month.

**Both said yes. Both meant different things.** A relay translates both yeses
perfectly, neither party ever learns they diverged, and six months later that is a
court case. The translation was correct and the outcome was a dispute.

So the system tracks a *state* per term:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `AGREED` | both sides, same value — safe to draft |
| `DIVERGED` | **both said yes to different values** — nobody realises |
| `HEDGED` | *"dekhte hain"* — a soft non-answer, never an agreement |
| `PROPOSED` | on the table, including open haggling |
| `REJECTED` / `OPEN` | refused / never discussed |

`DIVERGED` is a state no translation layer can produce. That is the product.

## Architecture

```
Party A mic ──WS──┐                            ┌── notes panel (term sheet + captions)
                  ├──→  FastAPI relay  ──────→ ┤
Party B mic ──WS──┘         │                  └── notes panel (term sheet + captions)
                            │
  per VAD segment:  Sarvam STT WS ──→ /translate ──→ live captions to the OTHER party
                            │
  on VAD end-of-turn:  sarvam-30b + tools ──→ mediator state ──→ both panels
                            │
                      Bulbul TTS ──→ one spoken relay sentence to the listener
```

- `app/sarvam.py` — every Sarvam endpoint/param in one place, so `verify.py` proves them all
- `app/mediator.py` — **the scored core.** Term state machine + divergence detection, scoped per room
- `app/agent.py` — one tool-calling `sarvam-30b` call per completed turn
- `app/stt_stream.py` — Sarvam STT WebSocket URL builder + frame classifier
- `app/session.py` — snapshot persistence (file-based; also reused for the DB path)
- `app/meet_interface/` — the real-time meet:
  - `rooms.py` — in-memory room registry (create/join, max 2 participants), Postgres-backed for durability
  - `db.py` — Neon Postgres: rooms, participants, term-sheet snapshots (degrades to in-memory-only if unreachable)
  - `languages.py` — supported languages (English + Indian languages) and their TTS speakers
  - `ws.py` — the live relay: browser PCM16 → Sarvam STT WS → live captions + one agent call per turn → TTS → broadcast
  - `app.py` — router: `POST /api/meet/rooms`, `GET /api/meet/languages`, `WS /api/meet/ws/{code}`
- `frontend/` — Next.js 14 app (TypeScript, Tailwind, Zustand), built as a **static export** and served by FastAPI at `/meet`
- `verify.py` — first-hour Sarvam API preflight

## Tech stack

| Layer | What we use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Speech in** | **Saaras v3** (`saaras:v3`, `mode=codemix`) — REST + streaming WebSocket | 23 languages, code-mix native. Word timestamps and server-side VAD (`START_SPEECH`/`END_SPEECH`) segment turns. |
| **Speech out** | **Bulbul v3** (`bulbul:v3`) | 11 languages, 30+ voices. Each party gets a distinct voice; `pace` shifts for sensitive moments. |
| **Translation** | **Mayura v1** (`mayura:v1`) | `code-mixed` for on-screen notes, `formal` for anything spoken aloud. |
| **Reasoning** | **gpt-4o-mini** via OpenAI SDK | Tool calling for the mediator agent. Swappable to `sarvam-30b` with one env var (`AGENT_PROVIDER=sarvam`). |
| **Audio capture** | `sounddevice` / Web Audio `AudioWorklet` | Raw 16 kHz `pcm_s16le` — the STT WebSocket rejects webm/opus. |
| **Backend** | FastAPI + `websockets`, `httpx` | One WS per party, proxied to Sarvam's STT socket. |
| **Frontend** | Single HTML page, no build step | |
| **State** | Append-only JSON log on disk | Survives a live server restart. No database. |
| **SDK** | `sarvamai` (`pip install sarvamai`) | Official client — typed errors, async, streaming. |

**Why the split:** `sarvam-30b` is capped at 40 req/min. Moving reasoning to
`gpt-4o-mini` frees that entire budget for speech, and `/translate` is a *separate*
60/min bucket, so live notes never eat the reasoning quota.

## Run

```powershell
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env      # paste the Sarvam API key + a Postgres DATABASE_URL

cd frontend
npm install
npm run build                # static export -> frontend/out/
cd ..

uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` — it redirects straight to the meet UI (`/meet`). Create
a meeting, share the code (or the link), and join from a second tab/device.

Optional hot-reload dev mode while iterating on frontend components: `npm run dev` in
`frontend/` (port 3000) against the backend on 8000 — the one cross-origin case, which
is why CORS is enabled for `http://localhost:3000` in `app/main.py`.

## What you need to supply

- **`SARVAM_API_KEY`** — root `.env`.
- **`DATABASE_URL`** — a Postgres connection string (Neon or otherwise), root `.env`. Rooms still
  work with no DB configured (in-memory only) — a room just won't survive a server restart.

## Open before demo

- [ ] `verify.py` all green on venue wifi; note real latency
- [ ] confirm `speaker` names valid for every language in `app/meet_interface/languages.py`
      (only `gu-IN`→`ratan` and `ml-IN`→`shubh` are confirmed against live docs)
- [ ] two devices, two languages, one call: divergence still turns a term red
- [ ] restart the server mid-call once — a rejoined room's term sheet survives
